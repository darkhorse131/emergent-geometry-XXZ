# Emergent Geometry from Mutual Information in the XXZ Spin Chain

This repository contains the full reproducibility code and environment for the paper:

> **Leighton-Trudel (2025)**  
> *Emergent Distance from Mutual Information in the Critical 1‑D XXZ Spin Chain*

## 📁 Contents

- `Emergent-Geometry-XXZ-Code/`  
  - `src/` — Simulation and analysis code (DMRG, MI tools, validation scripts)  
  - `Jupyter Notebook/` — Notebook used to generate all paper figures  
  - `Tests/` — Model validation tests  
  - `environment_FSS-env.yml` — Conda environment file for full reproducibility

## 🚀 Getting Started

To recreate results from the paper:

```bash
conda env create -f environment_FSS-env.yml
conda activate FSS-env
jupyter notebook "Jupyter Notebook/emergent-geometry-XXZ-figs.ipynb"

## 📊 Raw Data

The raw data (mutual information profiles, emergent distances, etc.) used to generate figures can be fully regenerated by running the scripts in `src/` or the provided Jupyter notebook.
